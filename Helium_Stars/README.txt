The "inlist_He_core" creates the helium core of a 30 solar masses star with
solar metallicity.

The "inlist_He_star" creates helium stars by removing the hydrogen mantle via
winds.

The fortran extension seems to be necessary for GitHub to highlight syntax but
you can/should use the inlists as plain text files.
